## Inspiration
We are developers from Nepal and our country Nepal is a agriculture based country with over 63% of our economy directly or indirectly depending on Agricilture, Even so we found that there is no proper platform for farmers to discuss their condition, problems and communicate with each other. With the aim to make Farming more efficient we started this project.
