## General info
According to FAO more that 60% of the world's population depends on agriculture for survival. When we say it depends on agriculture we mean it depends on farmers, Farmers have been the backbone of our world. However after extensive research No any web portal was found that could link farmers around the world virtually, this was a major problem as this would create boundaries and distance within farmers, To tackle this problem we came up with the idea of Goodleaf, It's a global platform for farmers to come together.In the coming days : The site will also look forward to coordinate with various agricultural experts around the world , allowing free consultation services to farmers by experts , providing quick , efficient and effective services to the farmers.In many parts of the world , the farmers donot get effective crop production due to lack of timely consultancy andgrowing process . This site can help combat this problem and ultimately improve agriculture globally

## Scope
Farmers globally can interact understanding each other's areas' plant species . 
Along with farming , this can also , in coming times be developed as a portal for Animal Husbandry , Dairy , Interactions  thus giving back to the community a lot of learnings , agriculture related career trainings and ultimately , becoming a shared platform for all the farmers as well as aspirants in the farming sector.

## Inspiration
We are developers from Nepal and our country Nepal is a agriculture based country with over 63% of our economy directly or indirectly depending on Agricilture, Even so we found that there is no proper platform for farmers to discuss their condition, problems and communicate with each other. With the aim to make Farming more efficient we started this project.
